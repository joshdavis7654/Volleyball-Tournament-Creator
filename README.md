# Volleyball-Tournament-Creator
Project to create an automated tournament software to allow input of teams and scores by a user. This software will make a schedule based on specific user selected rule type and automates through each round after scores are inputted till there is a winner. 

To run software compile files and run java TournamentFrame. Note:Tournament frame needs to be revamped as it does not currently provide enough user feedback or instruction. 

To start a tournament click the create new button under the tournament select tab. Select a tournament type and name the tournament. Then go to team management tab and hit the create new button. Do this and add as many teams as necessary. You can select the top team button to make sure top teams try and get matched away from other top teams in the first round. You can make more then one tournament at a time and teams will stay designated to the tournament they have been created in. Go back to tournament select tab and click create bracket with current teams. 

Now that the tournament is created, make sure the tournament you want to enter scores in is selected and go to the match scoring tab. Use the drop down tab to select games. The drop down tab will show the games in the current round and once all scored will repopulate with the next round. This will repeat until the championship round and a winner is declared.
